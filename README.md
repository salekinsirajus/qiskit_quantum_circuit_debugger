# Breakpoint Debugging on a Physical Qunatum Circuit

## Problem Description
In classical computing, debugging with breakpoint means halting the program
execution at any given point and freezing the program state. This allows
programmers to examine the program internals mid-execution (as in, what
variables contain which values, analyze control flow etc.) Unfortunately, in
quantum computing, doing this is not possible. Qubits in a quantum circuit have
probabilistic values (in superposition), and the act of measuring collapses the
qubits to a deterministic state.

Breakpoint debugging is still needed for quantum computing, so our problem boils
down to measuring at the breakpoint and preserving enough information to
“recreate” that state and continue execution from that point.

## Quickstart
1. Install with pip 
```
pip install qiskit_debugger
``` 

2. Import the following the classes to experiment with the debugger like this:
```
from qiskit_debugger import QuantumDebugCircuit, QCDebugger, run_circuit
```

3. A motivating example of how to use the debugger classes:

```
qc = QuantumDebugCircuit(2)
qc.x(0)
qc.h(range(2))
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.h(range(2))
qc.bp()      # <-- Add a breakpoint here
qc.h(range(2))
qc.x(range(2))
qc.bp()      # <-- Add a breakpoint here
qc.cx(1, 0)
qc.h(range(2))
qc.bp()

qc.draw()

# run each breakpoints
qdb = QCDebugger(qc)
qdb.c()
qdb.c()
qdb.c()
qdb.c()
```


Run the circuit as a whole w/o debugger

```
qc.measure_all()
result = run_circuit(qc)
print(result.get_counts())
```

If you want to use hardware you have to initiate the `QCDebugger` like so:

```
from qiskit import IBMQ

# loading IBMQ account
IBMQ.load_account()
provider = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='ibm-q-ncsu', group='nc-state', project='grad-qc-class')
# This is important, fill up the hw_backend variable like this.
hw_backend = provider.get_backend('ibm_oslo')

qdb = QCDebugger(qc, use_hardware=True)
```

## Solution Approaches 
Let’s assume we have a circuit with multiple qubits, and it has a breakpoint
brk. The circuit before the breakpoint is called A, and after is called B. The
target is to measure the state of qubits at point brk.

To “recreate”, i.e., synthesize an equivalent circuit right after it is
measured, we thought of two possible methods. 

~~1. **Approach 1**:
We make two circuits of varying length: one ends at the breakpoint, and the
other stops at the original end without stopping at the breakpoint. Then we run
both of these circuits.~~

(update 11/05/22): since this is a trivial and inefficient implementation, we
will focus our attention to approach 2.

2. **Approach 2**:
Create a custom gate using the unitary matrix that results from running circuit
part A, save it somewhere. Then create a custom gate using the saved unitary
matrix to circuit part B.This custom gate is equivalent to the circuit part A.
Now run this custom gate and then part B.

## Final Result
We have successfully implemented the first approach which uses a combination of simulation and hardware.
Using unitary matrices from unitary simulator runs and actual output from hardware runs,
we were able to correctly re-create the qubit states pre-measurement, and were able to successfully
resume the circuit after the breakpoint. Our implementation is readily usable as well. Our expectation with limited erorr propagation with this approach is also  
verified. This approach can aid the quantum computing programmers in interacting with
and debugging their code in a more effective way, as long as the circuit width isn't too big.

On the other hand, we found that the pure hardware approach is cumbersome and expensive to implement. The key driver behind
this approach is Quantum Phase Estimation, and while there are a number of algorithms uses this sub-routine, in
practice it is a) not very precise, b) hard to implement, and c) limits the number of breakpoints to a handful
due to error propagation.
